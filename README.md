Developed a Python script leveraging the Requests library to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API, allowing users to retrieve current weather data for a specified city. The script prompts the user to input their desired city, constructs a request URL with the appropriate API key and query parameters, and sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint. Upon receiving a successful response (HTTP status code 200), the script parses the JSON-formatted data to extract and display the weather description and temperature in Fahrenheit. In case of any errors, appropriate error handling is implemented to notify the user.
